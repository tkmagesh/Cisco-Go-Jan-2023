Why Go?
    1. Simplicity
        ONLY 25 keywords
        - No access modifiers (private, public, protected etc)
        - No classes (only Struct)
        - No inheritence (only composition)
        - No reference types (everything is a value in Go)
        - No exceptions (only errors)
        - No "try catch finally" construct
        - No pointer arithmetic
        - No implicit type conversion

    2. Lightweight
        - Close to hardware
        - No VMs, No JIT compilation
        - Tooling support for cross compilation
        - Performance is equivalent to C++
        
    3. Concurrency
        - light weight concurrency model
        - Concurrency features are built in the language
            ex: go keyword, channel data type, range keyword, select case construct
        - Standard Library
            sync package
            sync/atomic package
